## ðŸš€ Quick Start

Ready to create your first project? Use command-line arguments for project creation:

```bash
# Create a project with command-line arguments
./cpp-scaffold MyProject --type console --build cmake --package vcpkg --test gtest

# See all available options
./cpp-scaffold --help
```

### Interactive Mode _(Coming Soon)_

An interactive wizard is planned for future releases:

```bash
# Interactive wizard (not yet implemented)
